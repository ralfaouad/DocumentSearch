                This course is an introduction to digital systems design and covers timing concepts,
                area-delay tradeoffs, pipelining, and synthesis. Register transfer notation and VHDL
                are introduced to model, simulate, and verify designs. Topics include field-programmable
                gate arrays, technology mapping, layout synthesis, and routing.
