                This course provides an introduction to the design of embedded systems including both
                their hardware and software. Topics ranging from simple circuit design to computer
                architecture will be discussed. Different types of processors will be presented along
                with interfacing to memories, I/O devices, and other processors. The 68HC12 or PIC
                microcontrollers will be used as an example processor for assignments and the course
                project.
