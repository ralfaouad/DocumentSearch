            <Description>
                This course allows students to acquire basic knowledge of algorithms and methods of
                Artificial Intelligence, geared toward developing intelligent engineering solutions.
                The course covers concepts ranging over intelligent agents, fuzzy logic, neural networks,
                and genetic algorithms. A series of exercises, a set of simulations/ projects on computers,
                and a set of academic presentations (prepared in part by students) will allow students to
                better cover course materials, while concurrently developing applied projects. By the end of
                the course, students should be able to create software agents with intelligent features
                (intelligently perceiving surrounding environment, noise resistance, approximate (fuzzy)
                data processing, and simulating human behavior).
