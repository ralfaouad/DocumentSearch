			<Description>
			This course covers the basic heuristic optimization
			techniques in computing. This course describes a variety of heuristic
			search methods including serial simulated annealing, Tabu search,
			genetic algorithms, ant algorithms, derandomized evolution strategy, 
			and random walk. Algorithms will be described in serial as well as in 
			parallel fashion. Students can select application projects from a range 
			of application areas. The advantages and disadvantages of heuristic search 
			methods, for both serial and parallel computation, are discussed in comparison 
			to other optimization algorithms.
