                    This course covers basic concepts and methods related to continuous and discrete-time
                    signals and systems. The course includes: signals and systems and their properties,
                    linear time-invariant systems, stability analysis, sampling of continuous-time signals,
                    z-transform, discrete Fourier transform, time and frequency domain representations
                    of discrete-time signals and systems, and introductory concepts in communications.
