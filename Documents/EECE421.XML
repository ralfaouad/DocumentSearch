                <Description>
                    A course on the principles, techniques and trade-offs used in designing modern
                    processor core architectures. Topics include: benchmarking and performance evaluation;
                    hardware instruction level parallelism techniques (pipelining, superscalar, out-of-order
                    execution, branch prediction); software instruction level parallelism techniques (loop
                    unrolling, software pipelining, predicated execution, EPIC architecture), virtual memory
                    and high performance memory systems. Students will work on a VHDL design project of
                    a 2-wide superscalar microprocessor core.
