                    A course that teaches students modern processes and tools for working on software
                    projects, including the design, development, testing, and deployment of software
                    systems. They will understand and use agile development methodologies and tools,
                    including lo-fi UI sketching, user stories, behavior-driven development, and version
                    control for team-based development, management tools, and design patterns. The
                    course requires the completion of a group-based real-life software project.
