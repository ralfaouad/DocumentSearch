                Tracing the history of Lebanon from the rise of the Imarah to the 1989 Taif agreement,
                this course focuses on the formation of the Lebanese polity and identity and its place
                in the wider Arab world. It may deal with piv-otal figures such as Fakhr Ed-Deen and
                Emir Bachir, the role of the Maronites and their relations with France and the Vatican,
                the Ottoman period, the impact of the Tanzimat and the rise of the Mutasarrifiya. Key
                events and developments in the 20th century include the First World War, the French
                Mandate, Lebanese independ-ence in 1943, the National Pact, the 1958 events, and the
                1975-1990 War. How could the initial years of pros-perity lead to the outbreak of war in
                1975? The interaction between internal factions and communities and outside powers will
                be emphasized.
