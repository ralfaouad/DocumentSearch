                This course focuses on the emerging clash between the nascent Zionist project starting
                in the 19th century and the gradual dispossession of the Arab inhabit¬ants of Palestine
                culminating in the 1948 creation of the state of Israel. It aims to shed light on the
                historical progression of the conflict and the external players impacting its development.
                The course also assesses the Arab responses to Israel as well as the internal evolution of
                the Jewish state from frontier kibbutzim to nuclear power. Among events and developments
                leading up to 1948 the course may zoom in on the conception of Zionism, relationships
                between Zionists and the British and Ottoman Empires, early migration into Palestine and the
                impact of the two World Wars and the Holocaust. It will also address international responses
                to the existence of Israel arising from Arab and Palestinian nation¬alism, the Arab-Israeli
                wars, the emergence of the Palestinian Fedayeen and the Palestine Liberation Organization,
                the impact of Israel on surrounding Arab states and the Islamist factor.
